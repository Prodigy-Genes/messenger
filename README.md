This project is a mobile app that aims to replicate some of the key features of the popular messaging app, WhatsApp. It is built using React Native and TypeScript, leveraging various libraries and tools to provide a seamless user experience. The app is designed to run on both iOS and Android devices.

Features
Home Screen: The home screen displays a list of chats, statuses, and call history in separate tabs. Users can switch between these tabs to access their recent chats, view status updates, and check call history.
Chat Screen: The chat screen allows users to send and receive text messages to and from their contacts. It also supports sending images and emojis.
Status Screen: The status screen displays the status updates of the user's contacts. Users can view status updates, and they can also add their own status updates.
Call Screen: The call screen shows the call history, including missed, incoming, and outgoing calls.
